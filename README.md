# Fast-SVM-classification-using-data-reducer
Reducing the Number of Training Samples for Fast Support Vector Machine Classification python implementation.

This repository provides the python implementation of the algorithm proposed by
@reference  Ravindra Koggalage and Saman Halgamuge
Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, The University of Melbourne
Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia

in their Paper 'Reducing the Number of Training Samples for Fast Support Vector Machine Classification'. 
For visualizing the outcomes more practically, it's peformance on Iris dataset has also been implemented, 
and results were quite wonderfull as expected.
